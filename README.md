# Catalyst Voting Tools

A library and series of executables to aid programmers and users to
interact with the voting capabilities of Catalyst.

The "voter-registration" executable aids the user in registering to
vote. The executable creates a transaction, with the vote registration
encoded as transaction metadata, signs the transaction, and then
returns this signed transaction to the user, so they can submit it to
the chain.

The "voting-tools" executable has two functions: "genesis" and
"rewards". The "genesis" tool creates a genesis JSON file from a
"genesis-template.json" file, populating the file with the initial
funds and block-zero date. The "rewards" tool calculates the voting
rewards that should be given to each user and optionally generates the
appropriate MIR certificates.

## Development

```
# Launch a ghcid session for the given target
make dev target=lib:voting-tools
make dev target=exe:voting-tools
make dev target=exe:voter-registration
# Launch a ghci session for the given target
make repl target=lib:voting-tools
```

## Distribution

A static binary for the "voter-registration" executable is provided.
Due to limitations in our cross-compilation infrastructure
(specifically, static binaries of postgresql libraries cannot be
produced), a static binary cannot be provided for the "voting-tools"
executable.

The latest static binary can be found
[here](https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/voting-tools/native.voterRegistrationTarball.x86_64-linux/latest/download/1/voter-registration.tar.gz),
or built with Nix using:

```
nix-build -A voterRegistrationTarball
```
